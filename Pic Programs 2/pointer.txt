int n1=10;
int *p1=&n1;//*p is pointer variable of type integer, 
	  //which is used to store address of int variable

	 //here * means it is pointer variable which is used to store address...

Defination:Poiter is variable which is used to store address of any other variable...
we can used pointer variable with * sign.

to store addres of int variable we need integer pointer.
to store address of char variable we need char pointer.
to store address of float variable we need float variable.

example:
	int n1=10;
	int *p1=&n1;

	float x=1.1;
	float *ptr=&x;
